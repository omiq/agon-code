Keys:
```
  W
A S D

F = Fireball (fires in your direction of travel - you need to pick up a potion to top up your magic first)
O/P = Stab Left or Right (you need to pick up a sword first)
```
### Instructions

Doors open with keys, or by hitting them repeatedly until you break them or you run out of health.

Pick up all the idols to proceed to the next room.

Gather loot and health.

Avoid goblins and rats.
